# BuzzFeedr

## Overview
BuzzFeedr is a simple and effective news website that allows users to search articles on different news domains. Moreover, it has a very user-friendly UI which makes it a go-to companion for efficient news surfing.

## Technologies used
It is a front-end project that communicates with a news API to fetch the requested data from the user. I have not used any front-end framework for this project as I wanted to learn the fundamental approach to building a website so that whenever I use any framework I can appreciate how it is better than pure HTML, CSS and JS.
