# BuzzFeedr

## Overview
BuzzFeedr is a simple and effective news website that allows users to search articles on different news domains. Moreover, it has a very user-friendly UI which makes it a go-to companion for efficient news surfing.

## Technologies used
It is a front-end project that communicates with a news API to fetch the requested data from the user. I have not used any front-end framework for this project as I wanted to learn the fundamental approach to building a website so that whenever I use any framework I can appreciate how it is better than pure HTML, CSS and JS. To make the page dynamic I have used CSS flexbox and media queries.

## How to use

### Accessing
The website can be accessed easily by clicking on the following link and as the webpage is fully responsive and dynamic it can be accessed using any device.

### Finding News Articles
The website already loads the latest news articles from popular news topics like the Ukraine War, India, South Asia etc. 
News is displayed in a user-friendly card format, The card provides basic information but if the user clicks on the card it opens the extensive news-article of news for the user.

### Search Functionality
If the user cannot find the news articles they are looking for in the common section they can search their news on the search bar which is provided within the nav bar. This will provide the user with a whole set of articles based on the search query to select

### Buttons
For easy navigation, I have added several buttons and links to the webpage for example if buttons on the nav bar are clicked then several articles related to the corresponding button will pop up.
