# BuzzFeedr

## Overview
BuzzFeedr is a simple and effective news website that allows users to search articles on different news domains. Moreover, it has a very user-friendly UI which makes it a go-to companion for efficient news surfing.

## Technologies used
It is a front-end project that communicates with a news API to fetch the requested data from the user. I have not used any front-end framework for this project as I wanted to learn the fundamental approach to building a website so that whenever I use any framework I can appreciate how it is better than pure HTML, CSS and JS.

## How to use

### Accessing
The website can be accessed easily by clicking on the following link.

### Finding News Articles
The website already loads the latest news articles from popular news topics like the Ukraine War, India, South Asia etc. 
News is displayed in a user-friendly card format, The card provides basic information but if the user clicks on the card it opens the extensive news-article of news for the user.

### Search Functionality
If the user cannot find the news articles they are looking for in the common section they can search their news on the search bar which is provided within the nav-bar.
